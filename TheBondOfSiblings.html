You go back to the village where you find your sister waiting up for you. She
 looks very tired.
"What happened?" you ask.
"We got attacked by some undead," she says.

"Yeah, I'm fine".
"But... but..".
"No, but... but... I just wanted to tell you..".
"Tell me what?"
"I just wanted to tell you how much I love you".

> tell her you love her too

She smiles at you and kisses you before leaving.
"So... what's next?" you ask.
"Next? Well, we need to get out of here".

 her.


> help the girl

You help the girl because you care about her. You don't do it because you're

 You just do it.
> ask her if she knows where my sister is

You ask her where your sister is and she tells you that she doesn't know. You

 quickly as possible.
A few days later...
> think about your sister

You think about your sister and how she would have wanted you to do things differently.
 You also think about how you're going to handle this situation and whether or

 it.
> step off the ledge

You step off the ledge and into the air. You look down at the city below and
 see that it is indeed burning. The sky above is darkening and there is no sign
 of the sun. You wonder if you should head back home or continue onward towards
 the city.

You buy a small house in the city center. You live happily ever after...
